## Translations

For managing translation and the whole i18n process used special service â€“ [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/). Service allows to create unlimited amount of public projects for free, which means, that if even source code is private, you can still invite people to help with translation of you project.

Current automation works within support of special [GitHub Crowdin Action](url), which automates uploading and downloading sources and translations. Also, existing configuration allows use local CLI tool for the same puproses. One limitation, which exists, about updating the pull request from Crowdin service. It is possible via webhooks, but it is a paid feature.
