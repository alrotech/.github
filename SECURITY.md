# Security Policy

This short policy describe the best approaches in cases when you faced with any security issues in the code, or during usage of the built packages, or any other type of leak personal or sensitive data.

## Supported Versions

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) and follow [SemVer](https://semver.org) during the working process, which means that the most secure version is the **latest** version of the code.

We do not support previous versions, and we do not provide any LTS releases. We strongly recommend every time to update to the latest one. According to semantic versioning approach, major updates can contain backward incompatibility. Be careful during upgrade, always do backups, and keep attention reading release notes.

However, we try to keep backward compatibility when it is possible. Otherwise we provide explicit instructions for upgrading. We try to automate it with migration scripts as well.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

All requests about issues in MODX add-ons we receive via [the support portal](https://modstore.pro/office/support) on the marketplace website.

Alternatively, and all not related to addons requests you can send via email â€“ [support@mspay.by](mailto:support@mspay.by).
